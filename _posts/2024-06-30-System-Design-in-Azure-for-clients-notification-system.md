Welcome to my series on system design in Azure, where I take you through designing a complex system on the Azure platform.

Generally, there are 3 steps I follow when a client asks me to architect a system for them.

1. Phase 1 - Requirements Gathering
2. Phase 2 - Technical Deep Dive
3. Phase 3 - Communicating the Sauce

Now let's take a look at an example where a client asks you to:

"Please build us a notification system to let our users know when we post a blog"

## Phase 1 - Requirements Gathering
First, establish **functional requirements** by talking to the client. Here's how the chat might go:

Q: What channels do the notifications need to be delivered by?\
A: We want it to pop-up on their phone/pc, email and SMS.

{{ TODO }}

Now, we have our baseline functional requirements. Here's a summary:

In scope:
- {{ TODO }}

Out of scope:
- {{ TODO }}
Before moving on, repeat your summary with the client to double-check that you are on the same page.

Now, we need to establish the **non-functional requirements**.

Q: {{ TODO }}\
A: {{ TODO }}

Now repeat back your summary of the non-functional requirements:
- {{ TODO }}

## Phase 2 - Technical Deep Dive
At this stage, you should have a few technical questions in mind:

1. {{ TODO }}

### Phase 3 - Communicating the Sauce

Now, we've got an awesome architecture diagram to show our client, but we also need to communicate the benefits and deficiencies of our system when we talk to the client.

#### Benefits
{{ TODO }}

#### Deficiencies
{{ TODO }}

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations - you've got a happy and informed client.
