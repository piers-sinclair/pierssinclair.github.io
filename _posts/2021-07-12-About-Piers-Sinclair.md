Hey Guys,

Welcome to my blog on designing your apps for the China marketðŸ§§! 

I am a Senior Software Architect with more than 6 years of experience in databases and software development with various technologies. I am especially proficient in .Net using Azure and SQL with a multitude of front end technologies.

I have been involved in many industries, including Retail, Logistics and Job Management. When developing software, I have a passion for efficient development processes, designing quality solutions and building robust software architecture. I am very interested in understanding how systems work and coming up with innovative solutions to complex problems.

In my spare time, I am interested in the history and culture of China as well as developing my Mandarin Chinese language skills.

Well, that's me! I'm excited to dive into all sorts of topics with you guys ðŸ˜ƒ!
