China is an exploding market with more than 1 billion users to tap into. Tapping into this market as an international organisation can be a daunting task, yet it has the potential to deliver value to companies by vastly increasing reach. Nonetheless, many organisations struggle to break into the market. This fact is due to a range of reasons, from Chinaâ€™s complex set of unique technologies to cultural differences around application usage and connectivity issues as a result of hosting. 

Before we dive into this topic, letâ€™s take a look at some of the crucial factors that must be consideredâ€¦

* Integration with local single-sign-on offerings like WeChat
* Login via mobile number and mobile-first development
* WeChat MiniPrograms
* Consideration of local social media alternatives and how they integrate into your app (e.g. WeChat, Youku, BiliBili, Weibo, QQ etc)
* Local payment platforms such as WeChat Pay and Alipay
* Local hosting options for better connectivity (e.g. Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, Tencent Cloud)
* Colouring and UX design (e.g. red is a very positive colour)
* Smooth and consistent translation between Chinese and English
* Western integrations that may not work (e.g. Facebook)
* Publication in Chinese app stores
* Differing front-end technologies (e.g. Ant Design)
* The prevalence of QR codes
* Legal differences
* And much more!

Phew, that's a lot to take in ðŸ˜°! It can be an overwhelming experience with so much to consider. So, I want to explore the options that developers have when making the plunge into the Chinese market. It is worth noting that in China, Java is the most popular backend language but I am heavily experienced with the Microsoft ecosystem and C# language. As such, my aim throughout this blog will be to examine the different options available to .NET developers and how they can be applied in a flexible and maintainable manner.
