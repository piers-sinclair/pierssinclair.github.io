User stories are the backbone of any project, and yet often teams fail to give them the right time, care and attention to detail that produces truly great outcomes. Poor user stories lead to a host of problems including:
- Increased time waste as developers are unclear about expectations
- Lack of alignment between the business and developers
- Gaps in requirements being missed

There are 3 things I recommend doing to avoid these issues:
1. Spend time fleshing out the details
2. Spend time condensing details to the bare minimum
3. Get buy-in from the key business stakeholders AND the developers

## 1. Spend Time Fleshing Out The Details
Too often, I see a user story which has only a title, or it has some small scribbled notes in the description. Here's an example:

| **Title**          | Add pay button to shopping cart |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Description**    | We need a button to pay. |

It sounds simple right? But there are so many missing details. 
- Where should the button go? 
- What colour should the button be? 
- What text should the button have? 
- Which page is the shopping cart?
- Should the button have the functionality to pay, or is that another ticket?

It's crucial to spend time as a team figuring out what the details are. Failure to do so will cause confusion amongst the team and result in significant rework.

### 1.1 What Details Are Required?

Generally, I follow a pattern with user stories of dividing it into sections:

- Description
- Acceptance Criteria
- Screenshots (if relevant)
- More Context

#### 1.1.1 Description
This is the problem statement, it should contain no more, no less.

#### 1.1.2 Acceptance Criteria
This is the contract between the developer and the business, it outlines all expectations. Anything not covered in the acceptance criteria should not be expected to be completed.

#### 1.1.3 Screenshots (if relevant)
If the functionality being built affects the UI, then screenshots are a powerful story telling tool. As the old proverb says "A picture tells a thousand words".

#### 1.1.4 More Context
The description and acceptance criteria should be kept clean because they are the developers first port of call when they want to understand the expectations in the task. However, there are often additional details that are not part of the problem statement or contract, like notes or gotchas. It's a good idea to avoid adding these details to the description and acceptance criteria because they reduce the team's ability to quickly understand the issue.

Let's revisit our example with all of these details filled out:

| **Title**          | Add pay button to shopping cart |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Description**    | On [piers-sinclair.com/shopping-cart](https://piers-sinclair.com/shopping-cart)<br> we need a button to pay. <br><br>The button should look like the screenshot below. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | **AC1:** The button matches the design in the mockup below.<br> **AC2:** The button displays the standard success/failure message on click.<br> **AC3:** The button displays the standard processing indicator during background work.<br> **AC4:** The button calls the payment process from user story #123. |
| **Screenshots**    | ![Figure: The new pay button to be added.](/assets/images/2025-03-15-Writing-Great-User-Stories/1.png) |
| **More Context**   | - We previously implemented a similar payment button on the individual items. See user story #124<br> - Taylor knows a lot about this topic as they architected the payment process. |


Notice how much clearer it is what the expectations are? Imagine a developer going to implement the first one compared with the second one. With the first one, at best they have a lengthy call with the Product Owner to understand the requirements and at worst you end up with something completely different to the expected outcome!

### 1.2 How can you ensure time is dedicated to this process?
The above process probably sounds logical, but sadly reality often gets in the way. Distractions occur and it's all too easy for an unrefined story to slip through the cracks. To avoid this issue I recommend embedding the process into your planning and refinement processes.

How can we do that? By creating a rule that no ticket should go into the Sprint until it has been approved by the entire team. To faciliate this approval add a "ready" tag which indicates that the team has fully refined this user story and everyone agrees it has all details required to be worked on. Then when it comes to Sprint Planning if a user story has no "ready" tag it either has to be refined before being put in the Sprint or it is not allowed to be added to the Sprint. It's also helpful to build this "ready" tag into backlog refinement meetings. When you do refinement simply take the next few highest priority user stories from the backlog and refine them until they can have the ready tag. Not only will this improve the user stories, but it will also improve the flow and clarity of the backlog and it's ceremonies.

### 1.3 How can adherehance to these processes be enforced?
Adhering to the above can be difficult. It requires a strong will and complete buy-in from the team. If you start letting user stories in which don't meet the "ready" tag, the whole process will fall down. That's why the best approach is to get aligned with everyone on the team about this tag and encourage everyone to speak up if a "ready" tag is not appropriate. In particular, the Product Owner and Scrum Master should take careful lead to check-in with all team members about a user story and ensure that no user stories are flying under the radar.

## 2. Spend time condensing details to the bare minimum
Following processes that flesh out user stories can cause a huge time sink, espescially when the whole team needs to give buy-in. That's why representing user story information concisely is so crucial. Unfortunately, it is all to common for a user story to contain far too many irrelevant words and details that make reading it a cognitive nightmare. Here's an example:

| **Title**          | Add logic for paying for the items requested by a user when the user presses a payment button on the website  |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Description**    | GIVEN I am a user of piers-sinclair.com<br>WHEN I want to pay for a specific set of items<br>AND I press any pay button on piers-sinclair.com<br>THEN the system should have logic to process my payment by summing all the items requested according to the process architected by Taylor in #125<br>AND the user's card should be charged with the value calculated from the payment process. |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | **AC1:** Payments are processed according to Taylor's design in #125. This design was created as part of the initial focus groups conducted with users. <br>**AC2:** The payment process is generic and could be applied in many different places across the system   |

### 2.1 Keep it concise
It's vital that as the team writes a user story they start with a concise definition with as few words as possible. In doing so, the team will be able to understand what's expected in the user story quicker saving time getting alignment from others. It will also reduce time spent understanding the user story during development as the engineer revisits the user story requirements. A bit of extra effort upfront to make a concise user story saves exponentially more effort understanding the ticket later.

### 2.2 What to look out for?
There are several things to look out for when trying to streamline user story descriptions. Foremost are redundant words. The team should try to reduce the description to as few words as possible without losing meaning. That's also why the "more context" section is important, the description should convey the problem as lean as possible but sometimes there is valuable information that helps implement the feature but isn't directly relevant to the problem. There is far more leeway for lengthy content in "more context" because the developer will already have a clear grasp on the problem statement and acceptance criteria. 

Another thing I like to remove is patterns like given when then. In my experience, these patterns often add little value to a user story, increase cognitive load and are used as a crutch for writing poor user stories. I suspect this might be a controversial viewpoint, but I believe that most user stories can be conveyed in a far more concise manner using plain english.

Let's see how we can improve the example from earlier:

#### 2.2.1 Title
From
> Add logic for paying for the items requested by a user when the user presses a payment button on the website

To
> Add payment logic for requested items

We've removed references to the user, buttons, and website because they aren't particularly relevant to the process.

We've kept requested items because it's indicating that the payment relates to a set of items provided by the system.

#### 2.2.2 Description
From
> GIVEN I am a user of piers-sinclair.com<br>WHEN I want to pay for a specific set of items<br>AND I press any pay button on piers-sinclair.com<br>THEN the system should have logic to process my payment by summing all the items requested according to the process architected by Taylor in #125<br>AND the user's card should be charged with the value calculated from the payment process. 

To
> When payment is requested for items we need to implement the logic defined by Taylor in #125

- We have removed Given-When-Then which is adding significant complexity. 
- We have removed several redundant or unnecessary words. 
- We have removed references to the user's card because this is unnecessary extra detail which is implied.

#### 2.2.3 Acceptance Criteria
From
> **AC1:** Payments are processed according to Taylor's design in #125. This design was created as part of the initial focus groups conducted with users. <br>**AC2:** The payment process is generic and could be applied in many different places across the system.

To
> **AC1:** Payments are processed according to Taylor's design in #125. <br>**AC2:** The payment process is reusable system-wide.

Again we've removed redundant words. We've also removed the part about focus groups. This part isn't particularly relevant to acceptance criteria, but could be useful context so we can move it to more context.

Here's the final product:

| **Title**          | Add payment logic for requested items |
|---------------------|------------|
| **Description**    | When payment is requested for items we need to implement the logic defined by Taylor in #125 |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | **AC1:** Payments are processed according to Taylor's design in #125. <br>**AC2:** The payment process is reusable system-wide.  |
| **More Context** | Taylor's design was created from focus groups with users.  |

Isn't that a lot more straightforward and easy to read?

## 3. Get buy-in from the key business stakeholders AND the developers
Having well written user stories is only half the battle. It means the team can now easily understand and excute on user stories. However, to ensure a truly effective team, alignment between the business and developers is an absolute must. There are 2 sides to this story.

### 3.1 The Business Side
It is the responsibility of business personnel (e.g. the Product Owner) to ensure that all their requirements have been covered and to resolve any questions the engineering team might have about expectations and functionality. Acceptance criteria and availability are the 2 fundamental pillars here. 

#### 3.1.1 Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria forms the contract between the engineers and the business. The Product Owner needs to ensure that all expected changes are documented in the acceptance criteria, no matter how small. If the acceptance criteria is missing key expectations or contains irrelevant information it will undermine the credibility of the acceptance criteria and cause the team to avoid trusting the user stories assigned to them. 

It's also unrealistic to expect the acceptance criteria to be an immovable object, that's why when the acceptance criteria do change it is important to communicate the change to the team both verbally and through comments on the user story. The user story acceptance criteria should also be changed and reflect the *current understanding*, removing all references to previous understanding.

#### 3.1.2 Availability
Availability is another key factor for business personnel. The engineers are almost certainly going to discover unexpected roadblocks, missing details or new improvements. When they stumble upon these, it is crucial that the busiess personnel are there to answer questions, otherwise the developers will be blocked or risk going about implementing something that isn't aligned with the business.

### 3.2 The Development Side
Developers have the following responsibilities for ensuring alignment with the business:
- Understanding and Documenting
- Speaking up

#### 3.2.1 Understanding and documenting
Developers should ensure they fully understand and document expectations for a user story before it's added to the Sprint. It's all to easy to ignore user stories until they come up in the Sprint. This causes all sorts of disfunctions. 
- What if there are missing requirements that you identify through your technical lens?
- What if the business has not considered all technical problems, or effort level?
- What if it's not technically possible, or a spike is required to investigate options?
- What if there are blockers preventing work on this user story?

The developer should seek to understand not only the technical requirements but also the business process that ties into the feature. If a developer does not understand the business case of what they are implementing, they cannot hope to implement it correctly or identify potential problems with the proposed implementation.

Through understanding the user story and documenting all requirements, the developer gains clarity on what exactly is required and has evidence to support their case if requirements change in the future. This leads to greater alignment, happier business staff and protection for developers.

#### 3.2.2 Speaking up
It's impossible to anticipate all requirements and issues that might occur relating to every feature up front. Developers gain a unique, detailed perspective of a feature when they go to implement it. That's why it's vital for an engineer to speak up when they see an issue, roadblock or new idea. 

By flagging problems with the business, developers achieve better outcomes, create credibility with the business and build trust with the business stakeholders. Conversely, the developer who doesn't speak up may see their feature done quicker, but the result will be something the business did not expect, significant technical debt or a feature which is much worse than it could have been. Ultimately the business will notice these issues over time and lose faith in the developers work.

### 3.3 Pulling Together The Business And Development
So far, the responsibilities of business and developers have been established. But how can those responsibilities be brought together? This is where the "ready" tag again comes in very handy. By having a strong advocate for the "ready" tag and strictly following it's principles the team will build alignment naturally prior to the Sprint.

In addition to the "ready" tag a post completion handshake can do wonders for ensuring alignment. Developers should seek to demonstrate their feature to the Product Owner so they can get feedback and check that it meets all requirements. Any changes can be taken as a new user story, but the process shows that the developer cares about the work and the Product Owner gets the opportunity to ensure the feature meets their expectations.

## 4. Summary

Writing good user stories is a challenging, time consuming process which takes great willpower to execute well. Yet, when done poorly, it has disastrous consequences for a software team.

It is crucial that there are key advocates on the team who can champion fully fleshing out the details of user stories, keeping them as concise as possible and ensuring alignment among the business and engineers. With the right guidance on these matters teams can transform themselves from an inefficient mess to a well-oiled machine.

Could you be the advocate your team needs?
